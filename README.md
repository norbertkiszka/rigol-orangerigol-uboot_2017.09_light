## What is this?

This is a U-Boot forked from https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/OrangePiRK3399_uboot and optimized to be faster and lighter.

This is only for Rockchip SoC's. Code for other architectures was removed.

## Tested on...

Currently only on Rigol DHO924S (configs/rk3399-orangerigol_defconfig) which is based on RK3399 CPU.
